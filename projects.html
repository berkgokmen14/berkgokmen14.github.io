          <p> The growing complexity of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT and Llama, results in the degradation
            of performance and energy consumption for training and inference. To counteract this, Microsoft created a
            1.58-bit weight architecture named BitNet; it uses aggressive quantization by allowing the weights to be -1,
            0, or 1, leading to significant model size reductions. For our ECE 6745 final class project, our group
            wanted to build an accelerator for BitNetâ€™s attention kernel through three different methods: Vivado HLS,
            Allo, and Catapult HLS. </p>
          <p>I mainly focused on the Allo section of the project. Allo is a Python-based accelerator design language
            which can take in Python as input and spit out Vivado HLS code as output. It also automatically creates test
            bench files based on Python assertions, making the implementation and design process extremely easy. The
            performance of the accelerator was measured in cycles and the area of the accelerator was measured in LUTs.
            By the end of the project, we were able to achieve 19.3x speedup compared to the baseline accelerator with
            only 90% increase in area, still being able to fit on the FPGA. This involved optimizing the attention
            kernel through using simpler data structures such as fixed point, utilizing pipelining and loop unrolling,
            as well as loop tiling when complete unrolling was not feasible.</p>

          <p> As two big Star Wars fans, for our ECE 4760 final project, we wanted to create a lightsaber that could
            change color using the RP2040 microcontroller. Inspired by this, we created a lightsaber with two modes:
            disco mode and vowel detection mode.</p>
          <p>
            Disco mode changes the color of the lightsaber based on the frequency and intensity content of the
            surrounding sound. This is done by using a microphone and an FFT to gather frequency and intensity content
            of the input sound/music. The frequency and intensity is then mapped to HSV, where hue is a linear mapping
            from frequency and saturation is a linear mapping from intensity. The lightsaber includes a long LED strip
            that can be programmed with RGB values. Therefore, after mapping frequency and intensity to HSV, we map this
            back to RGB and send it back to the lightsaber.</p>
          <p></p>Vowel detection is a lot more complicated, as we wanted to create a vowel detector completely from
          scratch rather than using a pre-built detector/library. Our final goal was to distinguish the vowels EE and
          AH, where EE would result in the lightsaber turning red and AH would result in the lightsaber turning blue.
          Each vowel has different formant frequencies; as a result, to be able to distinguish EE from AH, we would need
          to extract these formant frequencies from the input sound. This is done through using cepstral analysis, which
          involves computing the FFT of the log-power spectrum, low passing the signal, and achieving a smoothed power
          spectrum by taking the inverse FFT. From this, we extract the formant frequencies of the signal and change the
          color of the lightsaber based on if it's closer to the frequencies of EE and AH. Our work here got published
          on Raspberry Pi's website!</p>

          <p> For our ECE 3140 Final Project, we decided to create a handwriting machine, which converts the text
            inputted in the program into handwritten letters on paper. This project had 2 main components: mechanical
            assembly and programming the software.</p>
          <p>For the assembly, we wanted to create a plotter that can move to any position on an xy-plane (the paper).
            To achieve this, we used two stepper motors and timing belts. By using these stepper motors, the tip of the
            machine (pencil) could move anywhere on the paper because each stepper motor controlled the position along
            each diagonal. However, we also needed to raise and lower the pen as well, so we included a servo motor at
            the tip of the machine used for this purpose.</p>
          <p>For the software side, we created a basic alphabet where each letter can be written using our grid. Since
            each stepper controls a diagonal, to draw a straight line on the paper, the stepper motors had to be on
            concurrently. To achieve this, we used the thread library created previously in the class using ARM
            assembly, and we made use of multithreading with round-robin scheduling to create the illusion that the
            motors were on at the same time. Each letter was mapped to a predefined combination of stepper motor
            movements that drew each letter and after drawing each letter, the motor moved to the right by a
            predetermined amount. Using such modularity allowed our handwriting machine to have different font sizes and
            page margins. Overall, this was an incredibly fun project, and we were very happy with the result!</p>
